  "body": "A developer needs to perform geographic load testing of an API. The developer must deploy resources to multiple AWS Regions to support the load testing of the API.\nHow can the developer meet these requirements without additional application code?\nA. Create and deploy an AWS Lambda function in each desired Region. Configure the Lambda function to create a stack from an AWS CloudFormation template in that Region when the function is invoked.\nB. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that defines the load test resources. Use the AWS CLI create-stack-set command to create a stack set in the desired Regions.\nC. Create an AWS Systems Manager document that defines the resources. Use the document to create the resources in the desired Regions.\nD. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that defines the load test resources. Use the AWS CLI deploy command to create a stack from the template in each Region.\nShow Suggested Answer",
