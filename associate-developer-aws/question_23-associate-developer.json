  "body": "A company has a multi-node Windows legacy application that runs on premises. The application uses a network shared folder as a centralized configuration repository to store configuration files in .xml format. The company is migrating the application to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration to AWS, a developer must identify a solution that provides high availability for the repository.\nWhich solution will meet this requirement MOST cost-effectively?\nA. Mount an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume onto one of the EC2 instances. Deploy a file system on the EBS volume. Use the host operating system to share a folder. Update the application code to read and write configuration files from the shared folder.\nB. Deploy a micro EC2 instance with an instance store volume. Use the host operating system to share a folder. Update the application code to read and write configuration files from the shared folder.\nC. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to host the repository. Migrate the existing .xml files to the S3 bucket. Update the application code to use the AWS SDK to read and write configuration files from Amazon S3.\nD. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to host the repository. Migrate the existing .xml files to the S3 bucket. Mount the S3 bucket to the EC2 instances as a local volume. Update the application code to read and write configuration files from the disk.\nShow Suggested Answer",
