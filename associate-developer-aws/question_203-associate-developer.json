  "body": "An IT department uses Amazon S3 to store sensitive images. After more than 1 year, the company moves the images into archival storage. The company rarely accesses the images, but the company wants a storage solution that maximizes resiliency. The IT department needs access to the images that have been moved to archival storage within 24 hours.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?\nA. Use S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) to store the images. Use S3 Glacier Deep Archive with standard retrieval to store and retrieve archived images.\nB. Use S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) to store the images. Use S3 Glacier Deep Archive with bulk retrieval to store and retrieve archived images.\nC. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to store the images. Use S3 Glacier Deep Archive with standard retrieval to store and retrieve archived images.\nD. Use S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) to store the images. Use S3 Glacier Deep Archive with bulk retrieval to store and retrieve archived images.\nShow Suggested Answer",

S3-IT will start at standard pricing, after 30 days > IA, after 90 days > archive instant retrieval. None of these are the most cost effective. S3-IT works well for use cases were there is no defined policy in place, i.e. after 1 year move to archive. reqs state archive after 365 days. s3-IT will action this after 90 days depending on access patterns."
