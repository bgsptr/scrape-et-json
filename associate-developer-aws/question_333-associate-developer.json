After deploying the Lambda function, the developer notices that the function is failing and there are AccessDeniedException errors in the logs.\n\nHow should the developer resolve this issue?\nA. Configure a VPC peering connection between the Lambda function and EventBridge.\nB. Modify their AWS credentials to include permissions for the PutEvents EventBridge action.\nC. Modify the Lambda function execution role to include permissions for the PutEvents EventBridge action.\nD.

Modify the Lambda function execution role to include permissions for the PutEvents EventBridge action.\n\nThe developer should update the Lambda function's execution role to include the necessary permissions for the PutEvents action on the EventBridge event bus. This will resolve the AccessDeniedException errors and allow the Lambda function to push events to EventBridge.",
