  "body": "A company uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to decouple its microservices architecture. Some messages in an SQS queue contain sensitive information. A developer must implement a solution that encrypts all the data at rest.\n\nWhich solution will meet this requirement?\nA. Enable server-side encryption for the SQS queue by using an SQS managed encryption key (SSE-SQS).\nB. Use the aws:SecureTransport condition in the queue policy to ensure that only HTTPS (TLS) is used for all requests to the SQS queue.\nC. Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to generate an SSL/TLS certificate. Reference the certificate when messages are sent to the queue.\nD. Set a message attribute in the SQS SendMessage request for messages that are sent to the queue. Set the Name to ENCRYPT. Set the Value to TRUE.\nShow Suggested Answer",
