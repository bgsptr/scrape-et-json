  "body": "A company has an application that uses Amazon Cognito user pools as an identity provider. The company must secure access to user records. The company has set up multi-factor authentication (MFA). The company also wants to send a login activity notification by email every time a user logs in.\nWhat is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets this requirement?\nA. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send the email notification. Add an Amazon API Gateway API to invoke the function. Call the API from the client side when login confirmation is received.\nB. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send the email notification. Add an Amazon Cognito post authentication Lambda trigger for the function.\nC. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send the email notification. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log subscription filter to invoke the function based on the login status.\nD. Configure Amazon Cognito to stream all logs to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Create an AWS Lambda function to process the streamed logs and to send the email notification based on the login status of each user.\nShow Suggested Answer",

Add an Amazon Cognito post authentication Lambda trigger for the function.\n\nThe most operationally efficient solution for sending login activity notifications by email for Amazon Cognito user pools is to use a Lambda trigger that is automatically invoked by Amazon Cognito every time a user logs in. This eliminates the need for client-side calls to an API or log subscription filter. A Lambda function can be used to send email notifications using Amazon SES.\n\nOption B satisfies these requirements and is the most operationally efficient solution.",
